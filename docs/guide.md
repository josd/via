# Deriva Guide

This guide introduces Deriva, a small Horn-clause language and engine whose source syntax is Prolog-like but deliberately its own compact language for facts, rules, goals, answers, and proofs. Deriva works over ordinary terms, lists, arithmetic, strings, and finite search. Run it with the `deriva` CLI, or use `node bin/deriva.js` when working directly from a source checkout.

This documentation uses **Deriva** for the project, language, and engine, and
`deriva` for the npm package and CLI command.

Programs write relations directly, for example `ancestor(pat, emma)` or `status(case1, accepted)`. Web identifiers can be written as ordinary quoted atoms that include angle brackets, for example `'<https://schema.org/name>'`, when a program needs explicit IRI-shaped names without prefix declarations. Deriva output is ordinary Deriva syntax: by default, the CLI materializes selected answer facts and prints those facts only. Pass `--proof` (or `-p`) when you also want each answer followed by a `why/2` explanation fact that records the proof. Programs may add `materialize/2` declarations such as `materialize(answer, 2).` to focus output on selected predicates.

Execution is automatically hybrid. Ordinary predicates use indexed
goal-directed resolution, while dependency analysis detects recursive groups
and tables their bound calls. Programs describe relations without choosing the
engine's search strategy.


For the normative language definition, including lexical syntax, terms, clauses, goals, built-ins, automatic hybrid reasoning, `materialize/2`, and conformance boundaries, read the [Deriva language reference](language-reference.md).

## Quick start

Deriva has no runtime npm dependencies and no build step. From a source checkout, run the CLI entry point directly with Node.js 18 or newer:

```sh
node bin/deriva.js --version
node bin/deriva.js examples/ancestor.pl
node bin/deriva.js facts.pl rules.pl
printf 'works(stdin, true) :- eq(ok, ok).\n' | node bin/deriva.js -
```

To install the published CLI instead, use:

```sh
npm install --global deriva
deriva --version
```

You can also use npm's local package-bin runner from the checkout:

```sh
npm exec --yes --package=. -- deriva --version
npm exec --yes --package=. -- deriva examples/ancestor.pl
```

To make the `deriva` command available on your `PATH` while developing this checkout, prefer npm's package link instead of a manual symlink:

```sh
npm link
deriva --version
```

`npm install -g .` is another local-checkout option if you want npm to install the package globally instead of linking it. Avoid hand-written `/usr/local/bin` symlinks unless you really need one; npm already reads the `bin` entry in `package.json` and creates the correct executable shim.

## Running the `deriva` CLI

The commands in this section use `deriva` for readability. In a source checkout where you have not run `npm link` or `npm install -g .`, replace `deriva` with `node bin/deriva.js`, or run the command through `npm exec --yes --package=. -- deriva`.

Show the package version:

```sh
deriva --version
deriva -v
```

Run a program and let Deriva print derived binary facts:

```sh
deriva examples/ancestor.pl
```

Enable proof explanations when you want machine-readable provenance:

```sh
deriva --proof examples/ancestor.pl
deriva -p examples/ancestor.pl
```

Deriva-readable explanations are opt-in proof output. Each `why/2` fact contains a nested abstract proof term, and a blank line separates consecutive explanations. Using Deriva syntax for explanations keeps them in the same language as the answers themselves: they are readable by humans, parseable by Deriva, easy to test, and can be transformed or explained further like any other Deriva data. For example:

```deriva
type(socrates, mortal).
why(
  type(socrates, mortal),
  proof(
    goal(type(socrates, mortal)),
    by(rule("socrates.pl", clause(4))),
    bindings([binding("X", socrates)]),
    uses([
      proof(
        goal(type(socrates, man)),
        by(fact("socrates.pl", clause(3)))
      )
    ])
  )
).

```

The explanation output can itself be read as Deriva input; for example, another program can materialize `why/2` facts such as `why(type(socrates, mortal), Proof)`. `--proof` adds only these explanation facts; it does not change the answers found by the solver.

### Explanation cookbook

Deriva answers can carry their own provenance when proof output is enabled.

Explain one derived fact:

```sh
deriva --proof examples/socrates.pl
```

The output contains the answer and a `why/2` fact. The proof term shows the source rule that produced the answer and the source fact used below it. Source references use `rule("file.pl", clause(N))` and `fact("file.pl", clause(N))`, where `N` is the 1-based clause number in that file.

Inspect variable bindings with a small policy program:

```deriva
score(case1, 95).
threshold(90).

status(Case, accepted) :-
  score(Case, Score),
  threshold(T),
  ge(Score, T).
```

```sh
deriva --proof policy.pl
```

The explanation contains the instantiated answer and the variables that made the rule succeed:

```deriva
status(case1, accepted).
why(
  status(case1, accepted),
  proof(
    goal(status(case1, accepted)),
    by(rule("policy.pl", clause(3))),
    bindings([binding("Case", case1), binding("Score", 95), binding("T", 90)]),
    uses([...])
  )
).
```

Use the `uses([...])` list to follow the proof tree. In the policy example it contains one subproof for `score(case1, 95)`, one for `threshold(90)`, and one for the built-in comparison `ge(95, 90)`. Built-ins are shown as `builtin(Name, Arity)` because they do not come from source clauses.

Reuse explanations as data:

```sh
deriva --proof examples/socrates.pl > socrates.why.pl
```

The resulting file is ordinary Deriva syntax containing both answers and `why/2` proof facts.

Compose multiple files, stdin, and URLs:

```sh
deriva facts.pl rules.pl
printf 'works(stdin, true) :- eq(ok, ok).\n' | deriva -
deriva https://example.test/program.pl
```

## Default output

Deriva programs write relation predicates directly:

```deriva
parent(pat, jan).
parent(jan, emma).

ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y).
ancestor(X, Z) :- parent(X, Y), ancestor(Y, Z).
```

By default, Deriva asks for new ground consequences of selected output predicates, suppresses duplicates, excludes source facts, sorts the result, and prints Prolog facts:

```deriva
ancestor(jan, emma).
ancestor(pat, emma).
ancestor(pat, jan).
```

This default is intentionally output-oriented. It is not a complete bottom-up saturation engine. Built-ins and proof search remain goal-directed; use `materialize/2` declarations and small output predicates when you want a specific relation, arity, or non-binary answer.

### Focusing default output

Large examples often have internal helper predicates. Add `materialize/2` declarations to restrict default output to selected predicates:

```deriva
materialize(answer, 2).

seed(case1).
helper(Case, score(95)) :- seed(Case).
answer(Case, accepted) :- helper(Case, score(95)).
```

The default output is then:

```deriva
answer(case1, accepted).
```

`materialize/2` is a declaration, not a logical rule to prove. It affects which predicates the CLI prints, not the meaning of the rules themselves. Materialized output facts are not inserted back into the running program for later goals. Source facts are indexed and reused normally, and answers for automatically tabled recursive predicates are reused inside the same solver run.

## Writing programs

A good Deriva program normally has three layers:

1. source facts;
2. helper predicates for calculation or search;
3. concise relation-style outputs, usually binary predicates such as `status(Case, Value)`, `reason(Case, Text)`, `ancestor(Person, Ancestor)`, or `cost(Path, Amount)`.

Example:

```deriva
score(case1, 95).
threshold(90).

accepted(Case) :-
  score(Case, Score),
  threshold(Threshold),
  ge(Score, Threshold).

status(Case, accepted) :- accepted(Case).
reason(Case, "score exceeds threshold") :- accepted(Case).
```

When `status/2` and `reason/2` are derived, they appear in default output. If the program has many helper binary predicates, declare the intended output predicates:

```deriva
materialize(status, 2).
materialize(reason, 2).
```

### Naming

Predicate names and atom constants use the same lexical form. Namespace-like names should be plain names such as `type`, `person_name`, or `odrl_permission`; colon names are not part of the language.

### Embedding remains general

The CLI is output-oriented and uses `materialize/2` to decide what to print. Embedders can still use the JavaScript API and `Solver` directly for arbitrary goals and arities.

Add `-s` or `--stats` when you want lightweight solver counters on stderr without changing stdout:

```sh
deriva -s examples/observability-log-correlation.pl
```

Add `-w` or `--warnings` when you want non-fatal portability diagnostics, such as unstratified `not/1` dependencies, printed to stderr while normal answer output still goes to stdout:

```sh
deriva --warnings test/conformance/warnings/negation/unstratified_mutual.pl
```

The playground has matching `--stats` and `--proof` checkboxes, so browser runs can show the same counters or explanations like the CLI.


### Builtins

Deriva builtins are registered by name and arity in small modules under [`src/builtins`](../src/builtins). This keeps the runtime portable to Node.js and the browser while giving each builtin family a clear boundary. Built-ins are called as ordinary Deriva predicates. See the [Deriva language reference](language-reference.md#9-standard-built-in-predicates) for the portable profile. The bundled implementation currently registers 80 name/arity entries across 78 predicate names:

| Family | Count | Built-ins |
|---|---:|---|
| Core and host | 4 | `eq/2`, `neq/2`, `local_time/1`, `difference/3` |
| Arithmetic, comparison, and generators | 29 | `neg/2`, `abs/2`, `sin/2`, `cos/2`, `tan/2`, `asin/2`, `acos/2`, `sqrt/2`, `floor/2`, `ceiling/2`, `trunc/2`, `rounded/2`, `exp/2`, `log/2`, `add/3`, `sub/3`, `mul/3`, `div/3`, `mod/3`, `min/3`, `max/3`, `pow/3`, `atan2/3`, `lt/2`, `gt/2`, `le/2`, `ge/2`, `between/3`, `smallest_divisor_from/3` |
| Strings and conversions | 15 | `str_concat/3`, `contains/2`, `matches/2`, `matches/3`, `not_matches/2`, `split/3`, `join/3`, `substring/4`, `replace/4`, `lowercase/2`, `uppercase/2`, `trim/2`, `number_string/2`, `atom_string/2`, `term_string/2` |
| Lists | 19 | `append/3`, `nth0/3`, `set_nth0/4`, `head/2`, `rest/2`, `last/2`, `take/3`, `drop/3`, `slice/4`, `member/2`, `select/3`, `not_member/2`, `reverse/2`, `length/2`, `sum_list/2`, `min_list/2`, `max_list/2`, `list_to_set/2`, `sort/2` |
| Aggregation | 5 | `findall/3`, `countall/2`, `sumall/3`, `aggregate_min/5`, `aggregate_max/5` |
| Control | 3 | `not/1`, `once/1`, `forall/2` |
| Context and terms | 5 | `holds/2`, `holds/3`, `functor/3`, `arg/3`, `compound_name_arguments/3` |
| **Total** | **80** |  |


To add a builtin, create or extend a module with `register(registry)` and call `registry.add(name, arity, handler, options)`. The default registry is assembled in [`src/builtins/registry.js`](../src/builtins/registry.js). Builtins that are only safe for specific argument modes should provide a `ready` predicate and `fallbackWhenNotReady: true`, so user-defined clauses remain visible until the builtin is applicable.


## Aggregation helpers

Deriva includes goal-directed aggregation helpers for finite searches:

```deriva
countall(Goal, Count).
sumall(Value, Goal, Sum).
aggregate_min(Key, Template, Goal, Bestkey, Besttemplate).
aggregate_max(Key, Template, Goal, Bestkey, Besttemplate).
```

Use `countall/2` for solution counts, `sumall/3` for numeric totals, and `aggregate_min/5` or `aggregate_max/5` when a search should keep only the best candidate instead of collecting and sorting every answer. The key can be a number, atom constant, string, compound term, or list; normal term ordering is used, so compound keys such as `[Cost, Path]` are useful for deterministic tie-breaking.

Example:

```deriva
best_cycle(Cycle, Cost) :-
  cities(Cities),
  aggregate_min([Cost, Cycle], Cycle, candidate_cycle(Cities, Cycle, Cost), [Cost, Cycle], Cycle).
```

## Context data

Comma terms can be data as well as conjunctions. Deriva provides two context utilities:

```deriva
holds((name(alice, "Alice"), knows(alice, bob)), name(S, O)).
holds((ready, name(alice, "Alice"), route(alice, bob, 7)), Name, Args).
```

Use `holds/2` when you want to match the member term directly, for example `name(S, O)`, `route(A, B, Cost)`, or `edge(A, arc(B, Cost))`. Use `holds/3` when you need the predicate name and argument list as data: it exposes any-arity member as atom constant `Name` plus a proper list `Args`, so zero-, binary-, and ternary members appear as `ready/0`, `name/2`, and `route/3` shapes without a special binary predicate. These utilities are useful for quoted context data, but they do not make those context members true in the ambient program. The [`context-schema-audit.pl`](../examples/context-schema-audit.pl) example shows a case that really needs `holds/3`: it audits heterogeneous message contexts by extracting every member as `Name + Args`, computing each arity, and checking the resulting shape against a schema without knowing the predicate names in advance.

`matches/3` can create context data from named regular-expression captures, which is useful when text logs or messages need to become facts before later rules inspect them with `holds/2` or `holds/3`. See [`observability-log-correlation.pl`](../examples/observability-log-correlation.pl) for a complete log-correlation example.

## Golden outputs, tests, and conformance

Golden answer outputs live in [`examples/output`](../examples/output). `npm run test:deriva` covers the deriva integration check, conformance cases, regression checks, runnable examples, and proof-output examples. A curated proof-output suite for `.pl` examples lives in [`examples/proof`](../examples/proof). Example tests pin `local_time/1` to `2026-05-30` so date-dependent examples stay deterministic. Regenerate them after an intentional output or explanation change:

```sh
for f in examples/*.pl; do
  [ -e "$f" ] || continue
  b=$(basename "$f")
  DERIVA_LOCAL_TIME=2026-05-30 deriva "$f" > "examples/output/$b"
done

for f in examples/proof/*.pl; do
  b=$(basename "$f")
  DERIVA_LOCAL_TIME=2026-05-30 deriva --proof "examples/$b" > "examples/proof/$b"
done
```

Run the full Deriva suite:

```sh
npm run test:deriva
```

The Deriva corpus runner runs in this order: Conformance, Regression/API/White-box, Examples. Each section prints its own subtotal, followed by a suite-specific grand total. The suite checks the conformance cases derived from the language reference, supplemental regression/API/white-box checks, and every runnable example against its golden output.

Run only one internal suite when you are iterating:

```sh
node test/run-conformance.mjs
node test/run-regression.mjs
node test/run-examples.mjs
```

Summarize the conformance corpus by category:

```sh
node test/run-conformance-report.mjs
```

Release preparation runs the same report and writes [`conformance-report.md`](../conformance-report.md), so each published package carries a current conformance summary.

The conformance suite lives in [`test/conformance/`](../test/conformance/) as a file-based Deriva corpus. Positive cases pair `cases/<name>.pl` with exact expected stdout under `expected/<name>.pl`; negative cases pair `errors/<name>.pl` with exact expected error text under `expected-errors/<name>.txt`; warning cases pair `warnings/<name>.pl` with exact `--warnings` stdout and stderr files under `expected-warnings/`; proof cases pair `proofs/<name>.pl` with exact `--proof` output under `expected-proofs/`. Cases may be grouped in category directories such as `arithmetic/`, `strings/`, `lists/`, `terms/`, `atoms/`, `variables/`, `negation/`, and `syntax/`, so another implementation can reuse the same corpus as an executable language contract. The suite covers the standard language surface from the language reference, including reusable built-ins, standard errors, standard warnings, and the machine-readable `why/2` proof-output contract. The regression suite lives in [`test/run-regression.mjs`](../test/run-regression.mjs) and covers CLI regressions, the public JavaScript API, and white-box invariants for parser, unification, and indexing behavior.

## Development and release

Common commands:

```sh
npm run test:deriva        # alias for npm test
npm test                    # full conformance, regression/API/white-box, examples, and proof examples
node test/run-conformance-report.mjs  # conformance coverage summary by category
node test/run-conformance.mjs
node test/run-regression.mjs
node test/run-examples.mjs
deriva --help
```

Useful profiling smoke test:

```sh
deriva -s examples/observability-log-correlation.pl > /dev/null
```

For a release:

1. update `README.md` and the language reference when behavior or public guidance changed;
2. regenerate golden outputs if behavior changed;
3. execute `npm test`;
4. execute npm version with `patch` (or `minor`/`major` as appropriate).

The `preversion` script reruns the full test suite and refreshes [`conformance-report.md`](../conformance-report.md). The version command updates `package.json`, creates the release commit and `v*` tag, and the `postversion` script pushes the commit and tag. The tag triggers the GitHub Release and trusted npm publishing workflows. A push to `main` also deploys the browser playground through GitHub Pages.

## Relationship to Eyeling

[Eyeling](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eyeling) and Deriva share the same goal of small, inspectable rule-based reasoning in JavaScript, but they make different language and implementation trade-offs.

Eyeling is the RDF/Notation3 member of the family. It reads N3-style triples, quoted formulas, forward rules written with `=>`, backward rules written with `<=`, RDF terms, RDF-JS data, and RDF-oriented streams. That makes it the better fit when data interchange with RDF/N3 tools is the main requirement.

Deriva is the compact Prolog-style member of the family. It uses ordinary predicate syntax such as `parent(alice, bob).` and `ancestor(X, Z) :- parent(X, Y), ancestor(Y, Z).` The core remains close to the Prolog tradition while deliberately staying smaller and more explicit than ISO Prolog. It is a good fit when the problem is naturally relational, goal-directed, finite, and does not need RDF graph interchange.

A useful rule of thumb:

| Use case | Prefer | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RDF/N3 data, triples, prefixes, graph terms, RDF-JS, RDF message streams | Eyeling | The surface language and APIs are RDF/Notation3-native. |
| Compact relational rules over ordinary terms, lists, arithmetic, and finite search | Deriva | The syntax is shorter for non-RDF relation programs and output is ordinary facts. |
| Human-auditable derivations | Either | Both can emit proof explanations when requested. |
| Large generated Horn-clause workloads | Deriva | The engine specializes in predicate/arity indexing, scalar argument indexes, fast fact paths, and materialized output goals. |

On local smoke benchmarks, Deriva is substantially faster on large generated Horn-clause and recursion-heavy workloads. These numbers are 5-run medians with stdout redirected to `/dev/null`, using Node.js `v22.16.0`, Deriva from this checkout, and Eyeling package version `1.34.6` with its default output mode. The ratio is `Eyeling median / Deriva median`, so larger numbers mean Deriva was faster.

| Example | Deriva median | Eyeling median | Ratio |

Treat these as smoke comparisons rather than a formal benchmark: hardware, Node.js version, package version, CLI startup, and output mode all matter.

The projects are therefore complementary rather than replacements for each other: Eyeling optimizes for Semantic Web interoperability and N3 expressiveness; Deriva optimizes for a small standard-looking relational rule language and fast finite goal-directed execution.

## Performance notes

Use `-s` or `--stats` for a quick sanity check while optimizing solver changes. It prints counters such as `solve_goals_calls`, `unify_calls`, `deterministic_rule_expansions`, `candidate_lists_selected`, `clause_candidates_considered`, `clauses_tried`, `max_depth`, and `max_solver_call_depth` to stderr, leaving normal output stable for golden-file tests. The `max_solver_call_depth` counter is especially useful for browser regressions, where the VM call stack can be tighter than a command-line run. Use `-w` or `--warnings` separately when you want portability diagnostics without enabling stricter parsing.

Deriva hashes predicate groups by name and arity, then indexes clauses by scalar argument values. It also builds two-argument composite indexes for scalar pairs and probes those composite indexes without per-lookup heap allocation. This helps both large generated programs with many predicates and selective queries such as:

```deriva
edge(g1, a, X).
path(a, Y).
status(Case, accepted).
```

Ground facts use a fast path that avoids freshening and copying a rule body. Recursive-predicate detection uses an explicit work stack, which keeps large predicate chains safer in the browser. Deriva automatically tables positive recursive groups, including dependencies reached through supported meta-goals and directly materialized relations. Cyclic calls iterate to an answer fixed point before replay. Recursive components containing a negative dependency retain guarded ordinary resolution because positive fixed-point tabling is not a semantics for unstratified negation. The engine also infers common structurally decreasing input positions; calls with an unbound structural input and fully open calls retain ordinary resolution rather than trying to materialize a potentially infinite relation. Authors do not need a search-control declaration.

Predicates can also carry advisory mode and determinism declarations for documentation and host tooling:

```deriva
mode(path, 2, [in, out]).
semidet(edge, 2).
```

For large programs, keep helper predicates selective, bind arguments early, document intended calling patterns with `mode/3` when helpful, and declare focused output predicates with `materialize/2` when default output would otherwise solve broad helper goals.

When using `not/1` over user-defined predicates, keep the dependency graph stratified: negative dependencies should not participate in recursion. The CLI option `-w` / `--warnings` prints non-fatal stratification warnings to stderr. The JavaScript API exposes `program.stratifiedNegation`, `program.negationStratificationErrors`, and `program.assertStratifiedNegation()` so host tools can warn or reject programs that rely on unstratified negation. The diagnostic is lazy by default; use `{ analyzeNegation: true }` to compute it during parsing or `{ strictNegation: true }` to compute and reject unstratified programs.

## Implementation limits

Deriva is intentionally smaller than ISO Prolog. It has no operators, zero-arity compound syntax, cut, modules, dynamic database updates, DCGs, or complete ISO library. Arity-zero data is always written and read back as an atom, such as `nil`, never `nil()`. Negation is negation-as-failure through `not/1`. Search is goal-directed and expected to be finite for the selected output goals. Output explanations are non-normative proof printouts and do not change answer semantics.
