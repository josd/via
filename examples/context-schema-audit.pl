% Context schema audit.
%
% This example needs holds/3 rather than holds/2 because the audit rule does
% not know the predicate names or arities in advance.  It inspects a whole
% context as data, extracts each member as Name + Args, computes the arity, and
% checks that shape against an allowed schema.

% Output declarations: query/1 selects the relations written to this example's golden output.
query(context_shape(X0, X1, X2)).
query(schema_violation(X0, X1, X2)).

% Program structure: each message carries heterogeneous context data.  The
% members deliberately use different arities: heartbeat/0, source/1,
% temperature/2, gps/3, and signature/4.
