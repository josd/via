% Diamond property, adapted from Eyelet's input/diamond-property.pl.
%
% A relation has the diamond property when two outgoing steps from the same
% source can be joined again.  This compact eyepl version keeps the same
% diamond idea and also checks that it is preserved by reflexive closure.

% Output declarations: query/1 selects the relations written to this example's golden output.
query(holdsFor(X0, X1)).
query(commonSuccessor(X0, X1)).
query(preservedUnderReflexiveClosure(X0, X1)).

% Program structure: facts set up the scenario, and rules derive the queried conclusions.
