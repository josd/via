% Law of cosines: c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos(C).
%
% This pure-geometry example keeps trigonometry outside the language by storing
% cos(C) as data.  Eyepl then performs the algebraic part of the theorem with
% ordinary arithmetic predicates and querys both c^2 and c.
%
% The 60-degree sample uses cos(C) = 0.5, so the proof shows each intermediate
% numeric step rather than hiding the computation in one builtin.

% The triangle fact stores the two known sides and the cosine of the included
% angle.  Storing cos(C) directly avoids needing trigonometric built-ins while
% still demonstrating the geometric formula.

% Compute c^2 first so both squared and square-rooted outputs can be shown.
% side_c_squared/2 follows the law of cosines step by step, then side_c/2
% takes the square root for the reported side length.
