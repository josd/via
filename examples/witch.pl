% This is the classic N3/Semantic Web rule chain in eyepl form: a duck
% floats; something with the same weight as something that floats also floats;
% things that float are made of wood; things made of wood burn; and a woman
% who burns is a witch.

% Output declarations: query/1 selects the relations written to this example's golden output.

query(madeOfWood(X0)).
query(burns(X0)).
query(witch(X0)).
query(is(X0, X1)).
